\usage{
mlxs_binomial(link = "logit")
}
\arguments{
\item{link}{a specification for the model link function.  This can be
    a name/expression, a literal character string, a length-one character
    vector, or an object of class
    \code{"\link[stats:make.link]{link-glm}"} (such as generated by
    \code{\link[stats]{make.link}}) provided it is not specified
    \emph{via} one of the standard names given next.

    The \code{gaussian} family accepts the links (as names)
    \code{identity}, \code{log} and \code{inverse};
    the \code{binomial} family the links \code{logit},
    \code{probit}, \code{cauchit}, (corresponding to logistic,
    normal and Cauchy CDFs respectively) \code{log} and
    \code{cloglog} (complementary log-log);
    the \code{Gamma} family the links \code{inverse}, \code{identity}
     and \code{log};
    the \code{poisson} family the links \code{log}, \code{identity},
    and \code{sqrt}; and the \code{inverse.gaussian} family the links
    \code{1/mu^2}, \code{inverse}, \code{identity}
    and \code{log}.

    The \code{quasi} family accepts the links \code{logit}, \code{probit},
    \code{cloglog},  \code{identity}, \code{inverse},
    \code{log}, \code{1/mu^2} and \code{sqrt}, and
    the function \code{\link[stats]{power}} can be used to create a
    power link function.

}
\value{
A family object compatible with \code{\link[stats:glm]{stats::glm()}} and \code{mlxs_glm()}.
}
\description{
Construct a binomial GLM family whose core link and deviance helpers are
implemented in R so they work with MLX arrays as well as base R vectors.
This avoids calling into compiled C routines that only handle base types.
}
\details{
Currently the \code{logit}, \code{log}, \code{cloglog}, and \code{cauchit} links are supported.
For other link specifications, fall back to \code{\link[stats:family]{stats::binomial()}}.
