\title{Bootstrap MLX arrays along the first dimension}
\usage{
mlxs_boot(fun, ..., B = 200L, seed = NULL, progress = FALSE, compile = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{Function called on each bootstrap draw. It must accept the same
named arguments as supplied through \code{...}.}

\item{...}{Arrays, matrices, or vectors that should be resampled along the
first dimension before being passed to \code{fun}.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap iterations.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for reproducibility.}

\item{progress}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, show a text progress bar.}

\item{compile}{Logical; compile \code{fun} once via \code{\link[Rmlx:mlx_compile]{Rmlx::mlx_compile()}} before
entering the resampling loop. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements \code{samples} (the raw results from \code{fun}), \code{B}, and
\code{seed}.
}
\description{
\code{mlxs_boot()} resamples observations from one or more MLX arrays, calls a
user-supplied function on each resampled batch, and returns the collected
results. Every argument supplied via \code{...} must share the same size in its
first dimension (number of observations). Arguments that do not need
resampling should be captured in the environment of \code{fun} instead of being
passed through \code{...}.
