# MLX-friendly Gaussian family

MLX-friendly Gaussian family

## Usage

``` r
mlxs_gaussian(link = "identity")
```

## Arguments

- link:

  a specification for the model link function. This can be a
  name/expression, a literal character string, a length-one character
  vector, or an object of class
  `"`[`link-glm`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/make.link.html)`"` (such as
  generated by [`make.link`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/make.link.html))
  provided it is not specified *via* one of the standard names given
  next.

  The `gaussian` family accepts the links (as names) `identity`, `log`
  and `inverse`; the `binomial` family the links `logit`, `probit`,
  `cauchit`, (corresponding to logistic, normal and Cauchy CDFs
  respectively) `log` and `cloglog` (complementary log-log); the `Gamma`
  family the links `inverse`, `identity` and `log`; the `poisson` family
  the links `log`, `identity`, and `sqrt`; and the `inverse.gaussian`
  family the links `1/mu^2`, `inverse`, `identity` and `log`.

  The `quasi` family accepts the links `logit`, `probit`, `cloglog`,
  `identity`, `inverse`, `log`, `1/mu^2` and `sqrt`, and the function
  [`power`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/power.html) can be used to create a
  power link function.

## Value

A family object compatible with
[`mlxs_glm()`](https://hughjonesd.github.io/RmlxStats/reference/mlxs_glm.md).
